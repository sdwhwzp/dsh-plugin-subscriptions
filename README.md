# dsh-plugin-subscriptions

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

Use your **ChatGPT (Codex)**, **Claude**, and **Grok (X Premium)** subscriptions as LLM providers in [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) — no API keys. Codex and Grok log in via OAuth in the dsh web UI (Settings → Subscriptions); Claude imports credentials from an existing Claude Code session when there is one (macOS Keychain or `~/.claude/.credentials.json`) and otherwise falls back to the same browser OAuth flow, so the Claude Code CLI is not required. Tokens live at `~/.dsh/plugins/subscriptions/auth.json` (mode 0600) and refresh automatically.

## Demo

Settings → **Subscriptions**: per-provider login/logout, no API keys. Claude imports credentials from Claude Code when available and otherwise uses OAuth, as Codex and Grok always do (account address masked in the screenshot):

Logged-in providers join the session model picker with their live model catalogs:

Models that advertise reasoning levels get an **Effort** selector in the same menu — Codex models, and Grok 4.6 / 4.5 (levels and defaults come from each provider's live catalog, not a hardcoded list):

Codex models whose catalog advertises the fast tier (the codex CLI's fast mode) get a **Speed** toggle in the composer's tool row, next to the model selector — Standard or Fast (`service_tier: priority`), per session. The `/fast` slash command offers the same choice as a popup; it errors with an explanation when the current model has no fast tier.

The `image_generate` tool renders its result inline in the conversation:

Its `provider` parameter picks the image backend — the same prompt through GPT (`gpt-image-2`, top) and Grok (`grok-imagine-image-2.0`, bottom):

The `video_generate` tool plays the generated clip inline:

## Providers

| Route    | Subscription      | Models |
|----------|-------------------|--------|
| `codex`  | ChatGPT Plus/Pro  | live catalog from `chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex/models` |
| `claude` | Claude Pro/Max    | all models available in your subscription (Opus, Sonnet, Haiku, Fable — static catalog, updated with the plugin) |
| `grok`   | X Premium (xAI)   | live catalog from `api.x.ai/v1/models` (chat models only); reasoning efforts from the Grok CLI catalog (`cli-chat-proxy.grok.com/v1/models`) |

Only logged-in providers appear in the session model picker; the lists above refresh on login/logout. Vision-capable models declare `['text', 'image']` input modalities, and image content is translated to each provider's wire format.

If live Codex model discovery is unavailable, the built-in fallback catalog includes GPT-5.5, GPT-5.4, GPT-5.4 Mini, and GPT-5.3 Codex Spark so their provider-reported token usage remains available to session accounting.

Logged-in cards also show **subscription usage** — per rate-limit window (5-hour session, weekly, and per-model weekly where the plan has one) with the used percentage, a progress bar, and the reset time, plus a Refresh button. Codex usage comes from `chatgpt.com/backend-api/wham/usage` (also reports the plan), Claude usage from `api.anthropic.com/api/oauth/usage`, and Grok usage from the Grok Build CLI proxy's `cli-chat-proxy.grok.com/v1/billing` (the source of the CLI's `/usage` panel; reports the shared weekly pool and the subscription tier).

Provider credentials and provider-level subscription usage are administrator-only when the host supplies authenticated account roles. Subaccounts can use the models assigned by the host, but the browser does not render login, logout, manual authorization, or provider quota controls. Direct credential-management and `usage` RPC calls are also rejected on the server.

Also included, registered when the matching provider is enabled:

- **`x_search`** tool (Grok) — xAI's hosted X search, returning `{ answer, citations }`.
- **`image_generate`** tool (ChatGPT or Grok) — `gpt-image-2` via the Codex backend, or `grok-imagine-image-2.0` via `api.x.ai/v1/images/generations`. The `provider` argument picks the preferred provider (`gpt`, the default, or `grok`); when the preferred one is logged out the other serves as fallback. Images are saved under `~/.dsh/plugins/subscriptions/images/` and the paths returned. The `size`/`quality` arguments map onto Grok's `aspect_ratio`/`quality` on the Grok path.
- **`video_generate`** tool (Grok) — `grok-imagine-video-1.5` via `api.x.ai/v1/videos` (async submit + poll); MP4s are saved under `~/.dsh/plugins/subscriptions/videos/`, the path returned, and the clip plays inline in the conversation. Supports duration (1–15 s), aspect ratio, resolution, and image-to-video via `image_url`.

## Install

With the `dsh` CLI available, install from npm (prebuilt artifacts, no build permission needed):

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-plugin-subscriptions
```

Or install the sources from GitHub:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add github:V1ki/dsh-plugin-subscriptions
```

pnpm will ask you to allow this package's build script on first install (git installs fetch sources, not built artifacts); add the printed key to the profile's `pnpm-workspace.yaml`:

```yaml
allowBuilds:
  dsh-plugin-subscriptions: true
```

and re-run the `add`. Only grant this to packages you trust — it runs the package's code at install time.

From a local checkout instead:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/V1ki/dsh-plugin-subscriptions.git
cd dsh-plugin-subscriptions && pnpm install && pnpm build
dsh plugin --profile web add ./dsh-plugin-subscriptions
```

Headless-only usage without installing into a profile (log in via the web UI first — the token file is shared):

```sh
cp overlay.example.yml overlay.yml   # then edit the name: to this checkout's absolute lib/index.js path
dsh --profile headless --patch <checkout>/overlay.yml "your task"
```

## Update

Installed from npm:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web update --latest dsh-plugin-subscriptions
```

Installed from GitHub: re-run the same `add github:V1ki/dsh-plugin-subscriptions` command — it re-fetches the sources and rebuilds. A linked local checkout just needs `git pull && pnpm build` in the checkout.

Either way, restart `dsh web` afterwards so the new version loads.

## Use

1. `dsh web`, open the printed URL.
2. Settings → **Subscriptions**: click **Connect** on a provider. For Claude, credentials are imported instantly if you have run `claude` and logged in at least once; without them, Claude authorizes in the browser like the others. For Codex and Grok, authorize in the opened browser tab; if the browser flow can't complete (headless host), expand the manual fallback and paste the callback URL or code.
3. In any session, open the model picker (`/model`) and choose a model under **ChatGPT (Codex)** / **Claude (Subscription)** / **Grok (Subscription)**.

Not logged in? The provider stays out of the picker, and requests fail with `MISSING_CREDENTIAL` pointing at the Settings page; nothing else breaks.

## Config

```yaml
- id: llm-subscriptions
  name: dsh-plugin-subscriptions
  config:
    providers: [codex, claude]        # subset; default all three
    streamIdleTimeoutMs: 300000
    models:                            # override the discovered/built-in catalogs
      codex:
        - { id: gpt-5.6-sol, name: GPT-5.6 Sol, contextWindow: 272000, inputModalities: [text, image] }
```

## Develop

```sh
pnpm install   # devDependencies link into a local deepseek-harness checkout — edit the paths first
pnpm build     # tsc (lib/) + tsdown (lib/client.js browser bundle)
pnpm test      # node --test over compiled unit specs
```

`prepare` (used by git installs) runs `tsdown.prepare.config.ts`: a self-contained bundle build of both faces with all `@deepseek-ai/*` specifiers external — they resolve from the dsh installation at runtime, so this package never carries a second cordis copy.

After `pnpm build`, restart `dsh web` to pick up changes.

## Layout

- `src/index.ts` — plugin entry: config schema, adapter registration, auth-change re-announce, RPC wiring
- `src/auth/` — PKCE/JWT helpers, token store, OAuth flow engine (temp loopback callback server), Claude Code credential reader (Keychain/file), authenticated `/api/subscriptions-auth/*` RPC endpoints
- `src/providers/` — per-provider OAuth constants/exchange/refresh + `LlmAdapter`s
- `src/translate/` — dsh `Message[]` ⟷ OpenAI Responses / Anthropic Messages wire formats, SSE → `StreamChunk`
- `src/tools/` — `x_search`, `image_generate`, and `video_generate`
- `src/client/` — the Settings → Subscriptions page (browser half, zh/en, theme-token aware)
